# females thus equal 1 for the female variable

# create an age variable
nes <- nes %>%
  mutate(age = 2012 - birthyr)

# create a dummy variable (called college) indicating individuals who have completed four years of college or post-grad: 
# Individuals who have completed four years of college or post-grad should be coded as 1 while all other respondents 
# should be coded as zero
nes <- nes %>%
  mutate(college = ifelse(educ=='4-year'|educ=='Post-grad', 1, 0)) # | acts as an 'or' statement, does 1 if true, 0 if not
# for the college variable, it'll thus equal 1 if the respondent went to some college

# linear regression with fthrc as the dependent variable and the variables youâ€™ve just coded, age, 
# female, and college, as independent variables
regresh <- lm(fthrc ~ age + female + college, nes)
