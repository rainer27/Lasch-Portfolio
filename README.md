# Lasch-Portfolio
Projects from my undergrad and free time

The projects contained in this small portfolio are a few that I have picked out to showcase my 
ability to clean, analyze, and visualize data, as well as my knowledge of machine learning. These
came from my undergraduate studies in political science and information science. I finished my
undergraduate at CU Boulder in 2023 with a major in political science and a minor in data science.
I hope viewers enjoy taking a look through my projects!
