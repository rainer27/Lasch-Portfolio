# Lasch-Portfolio
Projects from my undergrad and free time

The projects contained in this small portfolio are a few that I have picked out to showcase my 
ability to clean, analyze, and visualize data, as well as my knowledge of machine learning. 

I hope viewers enjoy taking a look through my coding journey!
